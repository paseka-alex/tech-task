The coding assignment is to write a program that reads from standard input or from a text file and writes to standard output.
It receives data about different geometrical 2D shapes. For each of them it should calculate perimeter and area.

Sample input:
Square TopRight 1 1 Side 1
Rectangle TopRight 2 2 BottomLeft 1 1
Circle Center 1 1 Radius 2

Sample output:
Square Perimeter 4 Area 1
Rectangle Perimeter 4 Area 1
Circle Perimeter 1 Area 2

Bonus points for:
- tests
- code that is easy to extend to add more shapes
for example “Triangle Point1 5 5 Point2 8 8 Point3 10 2”
